# SonosRemote
An Arduino YÃºn project that incorporates Arduino code and Python code (by way of the SoCo library) to recall radio presets, pause/play, and set volume of a Sonos speaker

This project is currently hard-wired to one named speaker. I will work on making this configurable on bootup next.
